Comparing the difference in proof generation time on KZG - ZK vs Non-ZK.

Benchmaring ZKG binding + hiding (Pedersen variant) vs binding to find the difference in time taken to create proofs when the ZK component is not required. 

Such a case can arise when all the data and state transitions are public and we only really want the SNARK component.
